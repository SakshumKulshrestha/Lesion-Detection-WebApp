Lesion Detection Progressive WebApp

A Progressive Web App to demo a segmentation and classification model using SegNet and MobileNet


A limited version of the model can be seen here: https://lesion-detection.herokuapp.com

The webapp implements two models, one for segmentation and one for classification of different skin lesions. However, due to free hosting, only the classifcation 
is being demoed. 

The model is very accurate for segmentation, and it has a 84 percent accuracy for classification. Here are some examples of segmented images.
